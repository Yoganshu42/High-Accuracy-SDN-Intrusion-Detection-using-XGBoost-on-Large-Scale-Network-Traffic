# 🔐 High-Accuracy SDN Intrusion Detection using XGBoost on Large-Scale Network Traffic

An intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS) built using XGBoost to secure Software Defined Networks (SDNs) from threats like DDoS and web-based attacks.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ *Achieved 99.8% accuracy* in classifying 5 types of network behavior: DDoS, Benign, and 3 web-based attacks.
- 📊 Used a *Kaggle dataset* containing *1+ million records* simulating large-scale SDN traffic.
- ⚙ Designed with a *focus on scalability and speed*, ideal for real-time SDN environments.
- 🧪 *Compared multiple ML algorithms* (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression) and selected *XGBoost* for best performance.
- 🧼 Performed *extensive data preprocessing*, feature selection, and handling of class imbalance.
- 📈 Visualized feature importance and confusion matrix using Matplotlib.
